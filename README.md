## 📖 About the Project

Web3 communities shouldn’t have to rely on expensive, fragmented tools to stay secure, engaged, and growing. Right now, projects juggle multiple paid bots, each competing for attention, diluting their own brand in the process.

S.L.I.C.E. changes that. It’s an open-source, all-in-one platform that unifies security, engagement, and governance under one roof. No more clutter, no more extra costs, just a streamlined system that keeps your community strong and your brand front and center.

We built S.L.I.C.E. to give Web3 projects control over their own spaces while fostering a healthier, more connected ecosystem. It’s time to take back ownership and build the future of Web3, one community at a time.

## 🛠️ Pre-requisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Poetry** for dependency management (`curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`)
- **PostgreSQL 13+** (running)

To install PostgreSQL:

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  sudo systemctl start postgresql  
   ```
- **macOS(Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install postgresql
  brew services start postgresql
  ```   
- **Windows:** Download and install from [PostgreSQL Official Site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## ⚙️ Installation

Provide a step-by-step guide for installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
   
2. **Install Poetry**  
    If you haven’t installed Poetry yet, run:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```
    Then, configure Poetry to use your Python version (if necessary):
    ```bash
    poetry env use python3.12  # Replace with your Python version
    ```
   
3. **Install Dependencies**  
    With Poetry installed, install all required dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
   
4. **Configure Environment Variables**  
    Before running the project, create a `.env file` based on the provided `.env.example`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit `.env` and fill in the required values:

    - Database credentials (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`)
    - API keys
    - Bot tokens 

5. **Set Up the Database (PostgreSQL)**  
    Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running, then create the database:
    ```bash
    createdb slice_db
    ```
    Note: The database credentials should match those in your `.env` file.

6. **Initialize Aerich (Database Migrations)**  
    Run the following commands to initialize and prepare the database migrations:
    ```bash
    poetry run aerich init-db
    ```
## 🚀 Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start the bot with:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.main
```
