## Our Promise
To foster an environment of true collaboration and a sense of community, we promise to create an experience free from any form of abuse, prejudice, or discrimination.

## Our Standards

- No harassment, witch-hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- No NSFW or obscene content.
- No disclosure of private information.

## Our Responsibilities
The project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and must take appropriate and fair corrective actions in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within the project's spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior can be reported by opening a ticket [here](https://discord.com/channels/1187435395823185960/1195025861490004028). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and the team will respond as deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.
